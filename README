Go-service provides a helper for long-running services that require
a mechanism for graceful shutdown. The service starts shutting down
either when a component stops and returns an error, or a chosen signal
is received. A service can call registered functions when shutting down.

The package documentation for go-service can be found at
https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/canonical/go-service.
